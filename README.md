# modiff - Model Difference

Compare two or more models. Get some useful data / plots.

This is a hackaton-mode early alpha.

## Purpose

This is supposed to be a convenient tool for comparing models.

Main two workflows:

* Exploration. You have a model and you want to compare its behaviour to behaviour of some model.
* Hypothesis testing. You want to test some hypothesis and you can express it in terms of difference between two models.
